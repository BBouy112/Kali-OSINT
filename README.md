# The Project

KALI-OSINT is a customized Kali Linux-based ISO image with pre-installed packages and scripts with extra OSINT tools. The idea behind this project is to combine a portion of Kali Linux tools and some OSINT scripts that are freely available on GitHub. 

I started KALI-OSINT as an educational and fun project to dive deeply into Kali Linux OSINT strategy. My idea was to create a VM with some Kali generic tools and pre-installed OSINT scripts. I learned a lot, and although it may not seem like it at first glance, configuring XFCE menues and correctly placing Python scripts and their dependencies has its challenges when embedding them in an installable ISO.  

However, I am not the one that got this idea first. I was inspired by [Trace Labs VM](https://github.com/tracelabs/tlosint-live) and [CyberPunkOS](https://github.com/cyberpunkOS/CyberPunkOS).

# Requirements

The official Kali documentation states that you will need a bootable USB drive or virualization tool to run the distro. A minimum of 3GB of RAM and 20GB of hard disk is required. 

# Download

Download the OVF file from Cloud Storage mega (https://mega.nz/folder/lHcTVICZ#Sjr2STWriFGdzXiH-SHdnQ) and install it on your preferred virtualization tool. I have tested it on VMWare Workstation 16 Pro. The file size is of almost 6 GB.
